this License, will be subject to the exclusive\n  jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts\n  its primary business.\n\nApplicable Law\n\nWithout prejudice to specific agreement between parties,\n— this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State\n  where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,\n— this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,\n  residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.\nAppendix\n‘Compatible Licences’ according to Article 5 EUPL
